### Créative, quelque fois rêveuse, on dit parfois de moi que je suis l'incarnation du calme.

## A funny story

First student job : I work at the reception desk of a museum. Every sunday, I'm often alone in the museum. Under the desk there is an emergency button. But nobody told me that. So one day, I find this red button : "mmm what is this button for...? And if I pushed it..." Nothing happens. I push back on the button. Still nothing. 5 minutes later 2 security guys come running. They thought there was a robbery at the museum. Oupsi...

### TD;LR

I push on red button... :bomb:
